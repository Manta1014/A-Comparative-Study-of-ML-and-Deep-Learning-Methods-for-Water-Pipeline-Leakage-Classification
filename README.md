# A-Comparative-Study-of-ML-and-Deep-Learning-Methods-for-Water-Pipeline-Leakage-Classification with ETRI

Conducted a comparative study on real-world frequency data from 391 water-pipeline sensors, benchmarking KNN, CNN, and Random Forest against deep models including a fine-tuned MLP and fine-tuned Graph Transformer for three-class leak classification (normal, general, micro)

Designed and fine-tuned a Graph Transformer model that applies attention across sensor signals to learn meaningful relationships among distributed pipeline sensors, achieving accuracy competitive with classical baselines while enhancing class-wise precision and interpretability
